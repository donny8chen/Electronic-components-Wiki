### The development history of electronic components

The development history of electronic components is actually a condensed history of electronic development. Electronic technology is a new technology that began to develop at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The 20th century developed most rapidly and was widely used. It became an important symbol of the development of modern science and technology.

In 1906, American inventor De Forest Lee invented the vacuum triode (electron tube) for amplifying telephone voice currents. The first generation of electronic products was based on electron tubes. At the end of the 1940s, the world's first semiconductor triode appeared. It has small in size, lightweight, power-saving, and long life. It quickly replaced electron tubes in a large area. At the end of the 1950s, the world's first integrated circuit appeared. It integrated many electronic components such as transistors on a silicon chip, making electronic products more miniaturized. Integrated circuits have rapidly developed from small-scale integrated circuits to large-scale integrated circuits and ultra-large-scale integrated circuits, making electronic products more efficient, energy-saving, high-precision, stable, and intelligent. Because the four stages of development experienced by electronic computers can fully illustrate the characteristics of the four stages of electronic technology development, the following will explain the characteristics of the four stages of electronic technology development from the four eras of electronic computer development.

The emergence and rapid development of the electronic component industry that emerged in the 20th century has caused earth-shaking changes in people's work and living habits around the world. The development history of electronic components is actually the development history of the electronics industry.

Due to the needs of social development, electronic devices are becoming more and more complex, which requires electronic devices to have characteristics such as reliability, fast speed, low power consumption, lightweight, miniaturization, and low cost. Since the concept of integrated circuits was proposed in the 1950s, the progress of comprehensive technologies such as material technology, device technology, and circuit design has led to the successful development of the first generation of integrated circuits in the 1960s. The emergence and development of integrated circuits have promoted the progress of copper core technology and computers. It has caused historical changes in various fields of scientific research and industrial society. The invention of integrated circuits with superior scientific and technological advantages has given researchers more advanced tools and produced many more advanced technologies. These advanced technologies have further promoted the emergence of higher-performance and lower-cost integrated circuits. For electronic components, the smaller the volume, the higher the integration; the shorter the response time, the faster the computing processing speed; the higher the transmission frequency, the greater the amount of information transmitted. The semiconductor industry and semiconductor technology are known as the foundation of modern industry and have also developed into a relatively independent high-tech industry.

#### Classification

**Electronic Classification**  
1、Components： Components are products that do not change the molecular composition of raw materials during processing. They are also known as passive components. Examples of components include resistors, capacitors, and inductors.  
Passive components are products that do not require energy. Examples of passive components include resistors, capacitors, and inductors.  
The components:  
1.1、Circuit components: diodes and resistors.  
1.2、Connection components: connectors, sockets, cables, and printed circuit boards.  

2、Devices： Devices are products that change the molecular structure of raw materials during production.  
2.1、Active devices： Active devices are products that consume energy and require an external power source.  
2.2、Discrete devices： bipolar junction transistors, field-effect transistors, thyristors, and semiconductor resistors and capacitors.  

**Resistors**  
Resistors are represented in circuits by "R" followed by a number (e.g., R1 represents resistor number 1). Resistors are used in circuits to divide voltage, limit current, and bias transistors.

**Capacitors**  
Capacitors in circuits are generally represented by “C” plus a number (such as C13 for capacitor number 13). A capacitor is a component composed of two metal films that are close together, separated by an insulating material. The main characteristic of a capacitor is that it blocks direct current and passes alternating current.   

The size of the capacitance indicates the amount of electric energy that can be stored, and the impedance of the capacitor to the alternating signal is called capacitive reactance, which is related to the frequency of the alternating signal and the capacitance.  

**Inductors** 
Inductors are not used very much in electronic production, but they are equally important in circuits. We think that inductors are similar to capacitors, they are also a kind of energy storage component, they can convert electrical energy into magnetic field energy, and store energy in the magnetic field. Inductors are represented by the symbol L, and their basic unit is Henry (H), usually using millihenry (mH) as the unit. They often work with capacitors to form LC filters, LC oscillators, etc. In addition, people also use the characteristics of inductors to make choke coils, transformers, relays, etc.  


**Crystal Diodes**
Crystal diodes are commonly used in circuits with “D” plus a number, such as D5 for diode number 5.   
Function: The main characteristic of diodes is unidirectional conductivity, that is, under the action of forward voltage, the conduction resistance is very small; while under the action of reverse voltage, the conduction resistance is very large or infinite.  

Because diodes have the above characteristics, they are often used in rectification, isolation, voltage stabilization, polarity protection, coding control, frequency modulation, and noise suppression circuits in cordless phones.  

**Combinational Circuit**
Integrated circuit is a device with a certain function, which is formed by integrating transistors, resistors, capacitors and other components on a silicon wafer using a special process. It is abbreviated as IC in English, and also commonly known as a chip.   

Analog integrated circuit is an analog integrated circuit that integrates resistors, capacitors, transistors and other components to process analog signals. There are many analog integrated circuits, such as integrated operational amplifiers, comparators, logarithmic and exponential amplifiers, analog multipliers (dividers), phase-locked loops, power management chips, etc. The main constituent circuits of analog integrated circuits are: amplifiers, filters, feedback circuits, reference source circuits, switched capacitor circuits, etc. Analog integrated circuit design is mainly obtained by manual circuit debugging and simulation by experienced designers. In contrast, most of the digital integrated circuit design is automatically synthesized by using hardware description language under the control of EDA software.   

Digital integrated circuit is a digital logic circuit or system that integrates components and wires on the same semiconductor chip. According to the number of gate circuits or components contained in the digital integrated circuit, the digital integrated circuit can be divided into small-scale integration (SSI) circuit, medium-scale integration (MSI) circuit, large-scale integration (LSI) circuit, very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit and ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) circuit. Small-scale integration circuits contain gate circuits within 10 or less than 100 components; medium-scale integration circuits contain gate circuits between 10-100 or between 100-1000 components; large-scale integration circuits contain gate circuits above 100 or more than 1000 components; very large-scale integration circuits contain gate circuits above 10,000; ultra-large-scale integration circuits contain gate circuits above 100,000. It includes: basic logic gates, flip-flops, registers, decoders, drivers, counters, shaping circuits, programmable logic devices, microprocessors, microcontrollers, DSPs and so on.

**Identification**
Identification of commonly used electronic components products  

**Resistance**
Resistance is represented by “R” plus a number in the circuit, such as R1 represents the resistor with the number 1. The main functions of resistance in the circuit are shunt, current limiting, voltage division, biasing and so on.  

1. Parameter identification: The unit of resistance is ohm (Ω), and the multiplier units are: kilo ohm (KΩ), mega ohm (MΩ), and so on. The conversion method is 1 mega ohm = 1000 kilo ohm = 1000000 ohm. There are three methods for marking the parameters of resistors, namely the direct marking method, color marking method, and number marking method.
   a. Number marking method is mainly used for small-volume circuits such as patches, such as 472 means 47×100Ω (i.e. 4.7K); 104 means 100K.
   b. Color ring marking method is the most widely used, now give examples as follows: four-color ring resistor five-color ring resistor (precision resistor).  

2. The position and multiplier relationship of the color mark of the resistor is shown in the following table:
   Color Effective Number Multiplier Allowable Deviation (%)
   Starting from the thinner end of the resistor
   Silver /x0.01±10
   Gold /x0.1±5
   Black 0+0/
   Brown 1x10±1

   Orange 3x1000/
   Yellow 4x10000/

   Purple 7x10000000±0.1
   Gray 8x100000000/
   White 9x100000000/


**Capacitance**
1. Capacitance is generally represented by “C” plus a number in the circuit (such as C13 represents the capacitor with the number 13). A capacitor is a component composed of two closely spaced metal films separated by an insulating material. The main characteristic of capacitance is to isolate direct current and pass alternating current. The size of capacitance capacity is to indicate the size of the ability to store electrical energy.

   The impedance of capacitance to alternating current signal is called capacitive reactance, which is related to the frequency of alternating current signal and capacitance capacity. Capacitive reactance XC=1/2πfc (f represents the frequency of alternating current signal, C represents capacitance capacity)
   
   The types of capacitors commonly used in telephones include electrolytic capacitors, ceramic capacitors, patch capacitors, monolithic capacitors, tantalum capacitors, and polyester capacitors.
   
3. Identification method: The identification method of capacitance is basically the same as that of resistance, which can be divided into three methods: direct marking method, color marking method, and number marking method. The basic unit of capacitance is farad (F), and other units are: millifarad (mF), microfarad (uF), nanofarad (nF), picofarad (pF).
   Among them: 1 farad = 10^3 millifarad = 10^6 microfarad = 10^9 nanofarad = 10^12 picofarad
   The capacity value of large-capacity capacitors is directly marked on the capacitor, such as 10uF/16V
   The capacity value of small-capacity capacitors is represented by letters or numbers on the capacitor
   Letter representation method: 1mF=1000uF 1P2=1.2PF 1n=1000PF, Number representation method: Generally, three digits are used to indicate the capacity size, the first two digits indicate the effective number, and the third digit is the multiplier.
   For example, 102 means 10×10^2PF=1000PF 224 means 22×10^4PF=0.2 2uF3. Capacitance capacity error table, Symbol FGJKLM Allowable error ±1%, ±2%, ±5%, ±10%, ±15%, ±20%.
   For example, A ceramic capacitor is 104J, which means that the capacity is 0.1uF and the error is ±5%.


**Inductance**
Inductance is usually represented by “L” plus a number in the circuit, such as L6 represents the inductance with the number 6. An inductor coil is made by winding a certain number of turns of insulated wire on an insulated frame. Direct current can pass through the coil, and the direct current resistance is the resistance of the wire itself, and the voltage drop is very small; when alternating current passes through the coil, a self-induced electromotive force will be generated at both ends of the coil, and the direction of the self-induced electromotive force is opposite to that of the applied voltage, which impedes the passage of alternating current, so the characteristic of inductance is to pass direct current and block alternating current. The higher the frequency, the greater the impedance of the coil. Inductance can form an oscillating circuit with capacitance in the circuit. Inductance generally has a direct marking method and color marking method, which are similar to resistance.   

For example, brown, black, gold, and gold represent 1uH (error 5%) inductance.  
The basic unit of inductance is: Henry (H) conversion unit is: 1H=103mH=106uH.  

**Diodes**
Diode is usually represented by “D” plus a number in the circuit, such as D5 represents the diode with the number 5. 

1. Function: The main characteristic of a diode is unidirectional conductivity, that is, under the action of forward voltage, the conduction resistance is very small; while under the action of reverse voltage, the conduction resistance is very large or infinite. Because of the above characteristics of the diode, cordless telephone often uses it in rectification, isolation, voltage stabilization, polarity protection, coding control, frequency modulation, and noise reduction circuits. The types of diodes used in telephones can be divided into rectifier diodes (such as 1N4004), isolation diodes (such as 1N4148), Schottky diodes (such as BAT85), light-emitting diodes, voltage-stabilizing diodes and so on.  

2. Identification method: The identification method of the diode is very simple. The N pole (negative pole) of a small power diode is mostly marked by a color ring on the appearance of the diode. Some diodes also use special symbols to indicate the P pole (positive pole) or the N pole (negative pole). Some also use symbols marked as “P” or “N” to determine the polarity of the diode. The positive and negative poles of light-emitting diodes can be identified from the length of pins, long pins are positive and short pins are negative.  

3. Test precautions: When using a digital multimeter to test diodes, the red meter pen should be connected to the positive pole of the diode, and the black meter pen should be connected to the negative pole of the diode. Only in this way can the resistance value be measured by the forward conduction resistance value of the diode, which is just opposite to the meter pen connection method of the pointer multimeter.  

4. The comparison of withstand voltage of commonly used 1N4000 series diodes is as follows:  
   Model 1N4001 1N4002 1N4003 1N4004 1N4005 1N4006 1N4007 Current (A) are all 1.  


**Zener diode**
The Zener diode is usually represented by “ZD” plus a number in the circuit, such as ZD5 represents the zener tube with the number 5.  

1. Zener voltage stabilization principle: The characteristic of the zener diode is that after breakdown, its two ends voltage basically remains unchanged. In this way, when the zener tube is connected to the circuit, if the voltage at each point in the circuit changes due to fluctuations in power supply voltage or other reasons, the voltage at both ends of the load will basically remain unchanged.  

2. Fault characteristics: The faults of zener tube mainly show open circuits, short circuits, and unstable voltage stabilization values. Among these three faults, the former one shows that the power supply voltage rises; the latter two faults show that the power supply voltage drops to zero volts or output is unstable.  
   Commonly used zener tube models and zener values are as follows:  
   Model 1N4728 1N4729 1N4730 1N4732 1N4733 1N4734 1N4735 1N4744 1N4750 1N4751 1N4761  

**Varactor diode**
A varactor diode is a special type of diode designed based on the principle that the junction capacitance of a common diode can vary with the applied reverse voltage. Varactor diodes are mainly used in the high-frequency modulation circuit of mobile phones or landline phones in cordless telephones, to achieve low-frequency signal modulation to high-frequency signal and transmit it. In the working state, the modulation voltage of the varactor diode is generally applied to the negative pole, so that the internal junction capacitance capacity of the varactor diode changes with the modulation voltage. The main faults of varactor diodes are leakage or poor performance:   
(1) When leakage occurs, the high-frequency modulation circuit will not work or the modulation performance will deteriorate.   
(2) When the varactor performance deteriorates, the operation of the high-frequency modulation circuit will be unstable, resulting in distortion of the high-frequency signal modulated and sent to the other party after being received by the other party. When one of the above situations occurs, a varactor diode of the same model should be replaced.  

**Crystal triode**
It is usually represented by “Q” plus a number in the circuit, such as Q17 represents the triode with the number 17.  

1. Characteristics: Crystal triode (abbreviated as triode) is a special device that contains two PN junctions and has amplification ability. It is divided into NPN type and PNP type. These two types of triodes can complement each other in terms of working characteristics. The so-called OTL circuit pair tube is composed of PNP type and NPN type paired use. The commonly used PNP-type triodes in telephones are A92, 9015, and other models; NPN-type triodes are A42, 9014, 9018, 9013, 9012, and other models.
 
2. Crystal triodes are mainly used for amplification in amplification circuits. There are three kinds of connections in common circuits. In order to facilitate comparison, the characteristics of crystal transistors and three kinds of connection circuits are listed below. Name Common Emitter Circuit Common Collector Circuit (Emitter Output) Common Base Circuit.
   Input impedance Medium (a few hundred ohms to a few thousand ohms) Large (more than tens of thousands of ohms) Small (a few ohms to tens of ohms)
   Output impedance Medium (a few thousand ohms to tens of thousands of ohms) Small (a few ohms to tens of ohms) Large (tens of thousands of ohms to hundreds of thousands of ohms)
   Voltage amplification factor Large Small (less than 1 and close to 1) Large
   Current amplification factor Large (a few tens) Large (a few tens) Small (less than 1 and close to 1)
   Power amplification factor Large (about 30-40 decibels) Small (about 10 decibels) Medium (about 15-20 decibels)
   Frequency characteristic High-frequency Poor Good  

**Field Effect Transistor**
1. Field effect transistor has the advantages of high input impedance and low noise, so it is widely used in various electronic devices. Especially using field effect transistors as the input stage of the whole electronic device, it can achieve the performance that is difficult to achieve by general transistors.  

2. Field effect transistor is divided into two categories: junction type and insulated gate type. The control principle of both types is the same. The symbols of the two types are:  

3. Comparison between field effect transistor and transistor Field effect transistor is a voltage-controlled device, while a transistor is a current-controlled device. In the case of allowing only a small current to be taken from the signal source, a field effect transistor should be selected; while in the case of low signal voltage and allowing more current to be taken from the signal source, a transistor should be selected. A field effect transistor is a unipolar device that uses majority carriers to conduct electricity, so it is called a unipolar device, while a transistor uses both majority carriers and minority carriers to conduct electricity. It is called a bipolar device. Some field effect transistors can exchange their source and drain, and the gate voltage can be positive or negative, which is more flexible than transistors. Field effect transistors can work under very small currents and very low voltage conditions, and their manufacturing process can easily integrate many field effect transistors on a silicon chip, so field effect transistors are widely used in large-scale integrated circuits.
   
   3.1, Electronic components: refers to the finished products that do not change the molecular composition during factory production and processing. Such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Because it does not produce electrons itself, it has no control and transformation effect on voltage and current, so it is also called a passive device. According to the classification criteria, electronic components can be divided into 11 categories.
   
   3.2, Electronic devices: refers to the finished products that change the molecular structure during factory production and processing. For example, transistors, electron tubes, and integrated circuits. Because it can produce electrons itself, it has control and transformation effects on voltage and current (amplification, switching, rectification, detection, oscillation and modulation, etc.), so it is also called active device. According to the classification criteria, electronic devices can be divided into 12 categories, which can be summarized into two blocks: vacuum electronic devices and semiconductor devices.
