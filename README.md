Electronic components are components of electronic devices and small machines and instruments. They are often composed of several parts and can be used interchangeably in similar products. They usually refer to certain parts of industry such as electrical appliances, radio, and instruments. Capacitors, transistors, filaments, springs, etc. are collectively referred to as electronic components. Common ones include diodes.

Electronic components include: resistors, capacitors, inductors, potentiometers, electronic tubes, radiators, electromechanical components, connectors, discrete semiconductor devices, electro-acoustic devices, laser devices, electronic display devices, optoelectronic devices, sensors, power supplies , Switches, micro-special motors, electronic transformers, relays, printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, various circuits, piezoelectricity, crystals, quartz ceramics and magnetic materials for printed circuit board substrates for electronic functional process-specific materials and parts such as electronic glue (tape) products , Electronic chemical materials and parts.

Electronic components have CE certification in quality internationally by the European Union (EU), UL certification in the United States (US), VDE and TUV certification in Germany and CQC certification in China and other domestic and foreign certifications to ensure the quality of the components.
