> The general term for components and devices

Electronic components are components of electronic devices and small machines and instruments. They are often composed of several parts and can be used interchangeably in similar products. They usually refer to certain parts of industry such as electrical appliances, radio, and instruments. Capacitors, transistors, filaments, springs, etc. are collectively referred to as electronic components. Common ones include diodes.

Electronic components include: resistors, capacitors, inductors, potentiometers, electronic tubes, radiators, electromechanical components, connectors, discrete semiconductor devices, electro-acoustic devices, laser devices, electronic display devices, optoelectronic devices, sensors, power supplies , Switches, micro-special motors, electronic transformers, relays, printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, various circuits, piezoelectricity, crystals, quartz ceramics and magnetic materials for printed circuit board substrates for electronic functional process-specific materials and parts such as electronic glue (tape) products , Electronic chemical materials and parts.

Electronic components have CE certification in quality internationally by the European Union (EU), UL certification in the United States (US), VDE and TUV certification in Germany and CQC certification in China and other domestic and foreign certifications to ensure the quality of the components.

### The development history of electronic components

The development history of electronic components is actually a condensed history of electronic development. Electronic technology is a new technology that began to develop at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The 20th century developed most rapidly and was widely used. It became an important symbol of the development of modern science and technology.

In 1906, American inventor De Forest Lee invented the vacuum triode (electron tube) for amplifying telephone voice currents. The first generation of electronic products was based on electron tubes. At the end of the 1940s, the world's first semiconductor triode appeared. It has small size, light weight, power saving, and long life. It quickly replaced electron tubes in a large area. At the end of the 1950s, the world's first integrated circuit appeared. It integrated many electronic components such as transistors on a silicon chip, making electronic products more miniaturized. Integrated circuits have rapidly developed from small-scale integrated circuits to large-scale integrated circuits and ultra-large-scale integrated circuits, making electronic products more efficient, energy-saving, high-precision, stable and intelligent. Because the four stages of development experienced by electronic computers can fully illustrate the characteristics of the four stages of electronic technology development, the following will explain the characteristics of the four stages of electronic technology development from the four eras of electronic computer development.

The emergence and rapid development of the electronic component industry that emerged in the 20th century has caused earth-shaking changes in people's work and living habits around the world. The development history of electronic components is actually the development history of the electronics industry.

Due to the needs of social development, electronic devices are becoming more and more complex, which requires electronic devices to have characteristics such as reliability, fast speed, low power consumption, light weight, miniaturization and low cost. Since the concept of integrated circuits was proposed in the 1950s, the progress of comprehensive technologies such as material technology, device technology and circuit design has led to the successful development of the first generation of integrated circuits in the 1960s. The emergence and development of integrated circuits has promoted the progress of copper core technology and computers. It has caused historical changes in various fields of scientific research and industrial society. The invention of integrated circuits with superior scientific and technological advantages has given researchers more advanced tools and produced many more advanced technologies. These advanced technologies have further promoted the emergence of higher-performance and lower-cost integrated circuits. For electronic components, the smaller the volume, the higher the integration; the shorter the response time, the faster the computing processing speed; the higher the transmission frequency, the greater the amount of information transmitted. The semiconductor industry and semiconductor technology are known as the foundation of modern industry and have also developed into a relatively independent high-tech industry.

#### Classification

**Electronic Classification**  
1、Components： Components are products that do not change the molecular composition of raw materials during processing. They are also known as passive components. Examples of components include resistors, capacitors, and inductors.  
Passive components are products that do not require energy. Examples of passive components include resistors, capacitors, and inductors.  
The components:  
1.1、Circuit components: diodes and resistors.  
1.2、Connection components: connectors, sockets, cables, and printed circuit boards.  

2、Devices： Devices are products that change the molecular structure of raw materials during production.  
2.1、Active devices： Active devices are products that consume energy and require an external power source.  
2.2、Discrete devices： bipolar junction transistors, field-effect transistors, thyristors, and semiconductor resistors and capacitors.  

**Resistors**  
Resistors are represented in circuits by "R" followed by a number (e.g., R1 represents resistor number 1). Resistors are used in circuits to divide voltage, limit current, and bias transistors.
